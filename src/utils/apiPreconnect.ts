/**
 * Preconnect to the Anthropic API to overlap TCP+TLS handshake with startup.
 *
 * The TCP+TLS handshake is ~100-200ms that normally blocks inside the first
 * API call. Kicking a fire-and-forget fetch during init lets the handshake
 * happen in parallel with action-handler work (~100ms of setup/commands/mcp
 * before the API request in -p mode; unbounded "user is typing" window in
 * interactive mode).
 *
 * Bun's fetch shares a keep-alive connection pool globally, so the real API
 * request reuses the warmed connection.
 *
 * Called from init.ts AFTER applyExtraCACertsFromConfig() + configureGlobalAgents()
 * so settings.json env vars are applied and the TLS cert store is finalized.
 * The early cli.tsx call site was removed — it ran before settings.json loaded,
 * so ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL/proxy/mTLS in settings would be invisible and preconnect
 * would warm the wrong pool (or worse, lock BoringSSL's cert store before
 * NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS was applied).
 *
 * Skipped when:
 * - proxy/mTLS/unix socket configured (preconnect would use wrong transport —
 *   the SDK passes a custom dispatcher/agent that doesn't share the global pool)
 * - Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry (different endpoints, different auth)
